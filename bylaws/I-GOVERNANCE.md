# Bylaw I — Governance

## 0. Definitions

The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not", "should", "should not", "recommended",  "may", and "optional" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

## 1. Summary

This document describes how decisions are to be made in the CSCU, and how responsibility is to be shared. It establishes the responsibilities of the CSCU Executive Members as decision-makers for the CSCU and a procedure for delegating responsibility to subcommittees ("circles" and "sub-circles"; see section "2. Circles"). It also describes the procedure circles follow to make decisions—namely, through a consensus model that centres identifying and resolving objections (see section "3. Decision-Making").

## 2. Circles

A "circle" is a group of people who share responsibility for something.

A circle may establish additional circles that act independently, subject to the veto of the circle that formed them ("sub-circles"). A sub-circle must have at least one member who is also on the circle that formed it who will act as an intermediary between the two circles.

When formed, a circle must have:

- A list of people who will be members of the circle
- A clear responsibility

Circles may make decisions (see "3. Decision-Making") that affect their own operations or those of sub-circles they formed. They may also decide to add additional members. A circle may decide to remove members from the sub-circles it forms.

The CSCU Executive Members form a circle, the responsibility of which is to uphold the CSCU constitution, and to manage and oversee CSCU operations.

## 3. Decision-Making

This section describes how circles make decisions. It only covers decisions of consequence to the CSCU and its membership; day-to-day operational decisions may follow this procedure if the circle decides they should, but they don't need to. Decisions that must follow this process include:

- Passing bylaws (see section "3.1. Passing of Bylaws").
- Decisions with long-term consequences (i.e. ones that will substantially affect future decisions).
- All decisions a circle decided should be decided following this process.

Decisions are finalized when there are no remaining "paramount objections" to the decision—that is, objections that are sincere and well-reasoned. If circle-members object to a decision, their objection should be made clear as soon as possible, and other members must listen to them. A course of action may be altered to accommodate the objection, or the decision may be dropped entirely. Objections must be made in a way that upholds the circle-member's responsibility, and, in the case of Executive Members, their responsibility as outlined by the CSCU constitution. If this process proves unsuccessful, circle-members may delegate the decision to a sub-circle or decide to use an alternative process, such as a simple majority vote.

After a decision has been finalized, it may be put into effect. It may also be reversed following the same process.

If a circle-member has been given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the decision-making process and does not, their absence shall be considered as them having no objections.

Executive Members shall document all decisions they make during meetings in meeting notes. Objections shall be documented as well, and they must be ascribed to the objecting member. These meetings notes must be made available to the CSCU membership before the following meeting and should be made available within the 48 hours following the meeting during which they were prepared.

### 3.1. Passing of Bylaws

Bylaws are general rules established by a circle that regulate its behaviour. They differ from regular decisions in that:

- They may apply to many situations
- They are decided in advance of when they are applied (i.e. bylaws are not "one-off" decisions)
- They are known to members of the circle before they are passed

Bylaws must be described in writing and provided in a way that is accessible to all members of the circle at least one week before the decision of whether or not to pass them is to be made.

#### 3.1.1 CSCU Executive Member Bylaws

If a CSCU Executive Member wants to propose a bylaw, it must be made available to the CSCU Membership through an official channel one week in advance in addition to the other Executive Members. Providing the bylaw in writing shall be considered sufficiently accessible for the purposes of availability to general members. Executive Members should give proposed bylaws to the Secretary who shall be responsible for publishing them.

If a bylaw is passed, it must be kept available online to CSCU members in a format that tracks revisions. Executive members should use Git or a similar technology to track revisions.

The bylaw described in this document (Bylaw I — Governance) must be adopted in accordance with the regulations it describes.
